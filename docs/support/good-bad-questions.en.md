# Before you attend a consultation ...

In our consultation hours, you can clarify your questions about the lecture and homework in 1:1 discussions with experienced tutors.
However, the office hours are *in no way* a substitute for the lecture.
Therefore, you are expected to have dealt with the following points in advance:

* [Lecture content] - indicated for homework on each sheet
* this student guide
* the [Moodle forum] - for homework exercises in particular also FAQ
* the documentation of the materials used

### Questions about solutions to homework exercises

We expect you to work on homework independently and to try to correct mistakes on your own.

You should only ask a tutor if you are really stuck. We expect the following from you:

* If you have received an error message, we expect you to have already dealt with the error message and tried to correct the error. 
* If you have a comprehension question, we expect you to have already thought of your own interpretation and tried to answer the question independently. You can then discuss with the tutor whether your interpretation is correct.


### Good Questions
Before you visit a consultation to clarify an error in your solution, you must be able to answer the following questions.

* In what context does the problem occur?
* What is the expected behavior?
* What is the actual behavior?
* Does an error occur? If so, which one?
* What have you already tried so far to solve the problem?

    You should *not* use these questions as a reference! If you ask a question along the following lines, 
    we will not answer it and refer you to this guide!

* *Is this correct?*
* *How do I solve the homework exercise?*
* *I implemented the exercise correctly, but the public tests fail. They must be wrong!*
* *I get this error message. Why?* (Without trying to understand it.)
* *My code does not do what it is supposed to do :(*
